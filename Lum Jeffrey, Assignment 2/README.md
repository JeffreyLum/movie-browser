# Jeffrey Lum - Movie Browser

## How this app works

> Type in the movie that you wish to search for and you will be displayed with the 10 closest results

> After you have obtained your search results, for each film, there will be the film's poster, title, and year of release. Under each film will be a button title "Show More", that will redirect the user to more details about the film including the plot, cast, film genre, etc.
> The "Show More" button takes that films IMDB ID and uses that to gather more information, this is so another movie with the same title does not display the wrong information.

> A QuickSearch is also available if you are sure the movie you have typed in the search bar is the exact movie that you are looking for and it will take you straight to the film result with all the extra details.
